\chapter{Practical Implementation}

\emph{This is a chapter for the thesis only to explain a selection of (possibly) interesting decisions made during the implementation. I want to keep this brief}
\begin{itemize}
\item Datastructure for the candidate map and how it is generated
\item Datastructures for the InstanceVector and InstanceMatrix, and why this construction improves time-complexity
\item Brief introduction of QVouw and what it offers
\item Availability
\end{itemize}
