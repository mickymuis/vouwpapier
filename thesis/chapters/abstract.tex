\chapter*{Abstract}
\begin{itemize}
\item MDL is a principle that utilizes compression as a means of describing data
\item There exist many MDL-based algorithms for a variety of problems
\item Few (no?) solutions exist to mine grid-like data based on MDL
\item VOUW is a novel approach to discover patterns and structural relations in 2D, discrete datasets
\item We propose both a theoretical framework as well as a complete, optimized implementation 
\end{itemize}
