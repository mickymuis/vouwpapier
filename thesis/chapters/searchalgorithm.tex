\chapter{A Search Algorithm}

\emph{I have this partially, but so much has changed that it will need to be rewritten anyway. I would like to split it in two parts: the absolute minimal baseline algorithm in one section, and then another to describe all the extensions and optimizations.}\\

\section{An Outline}

Given an input matrix, the algorithm is initialized with: (a) probability mass function of the values in the matrix, (b) singleton pattern for each unique element in the matrix and (c) the under-fit instantiation matrix containing only singletons.  The baseline algorithm is composed out of four stages that are repeated every iteration:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Candidate search
\item Gain computation
\item Candidate selection
\item Merging of patterns and their instances
\end{enumerate}

\section{Extensions and Improvements}

\subsection{Pre-processing}
\subsection{Reducing Self-Overlap}
\subsection{Alternative Heuristics}
\subsection{Local Search}
\subsection{Noise-Tolerance}
