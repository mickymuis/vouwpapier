\section*{Abstract}

We introduce geometric pattern mining, the problem of finding recurring local structures in raster-based data. It differs from other pattern mining problems by encoding complex spatial relations between elements, that result in arbitrary shaped patterns. After we formalize this concept, we discuss an approach using the Minimum Description Length-principle. We demonstrate the viability of our approach by introducing Vouw, an algorithm that solves a specific class of geometric pattern mining problems. We empirically show that Vouw delivers high-quality results by using a synthetic benchmark.
