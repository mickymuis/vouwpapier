\section{Related Work}

Krimp \cite{krimp} is probably one of the first explanatory data mining approaches using MDL and also one of the sources of inspiration for this paper. Since then, many papers on this topic have been published, such as Slim \ref{slim} (frequent item set mining, like Krimp), Classy \ref{classy} (mining classifiers), \emph{TODO: list more}

The work by Campana et al. \cite{campana2010compression} also uses matrix-like input data (textures) and develops a similarity measure based on MDL. Their method, however, cannot be used for \emph{explanatory} data analysis as they use a generic image compression algorithm that is essentially a black box.

Geometric pattern mining is different from graph mining, as a matrix is more rigid and each element has a fixed degree of connectedness/adjacency. It is also unrelated to linear algebra, other then using the term `matrix' and a comparable style of notation. 

\emph{This is still far from complete}
