\section{Related Work}

As the first pattern mining approach using the MDL principle, Krimp \cite{krimp} was one of the main sources of inspiration for this paper. Many papers on pattern-based modelling using MDL have appeared since, both improving search, e.g., Slim \cite{slim}, and extensions to other problems, e.g., Classy \cite{classy} for rule-based classification.

The problem closest to ours is probably that of geometric tiling, as introduced by Gionis et al.\ \cite{gionis2004tiles} and later also combined with the MDL principle by Tatti and Vreeken \cite{tatti2012stijl}. Geometric tiling, however, is limited to Boolean data and rectangularly shaped patterns (tiles); we strongly relax both these limitations (but as of yet do not support patterns based on densities or noisy occurrences).

Campana et al. \cite{campana2010compression} also use matrix-like input data (textures) and develop a compression-based similarity measure. Their method, however, cannot be used for \emph{explanatory} data analysis as it relies on a generic image compression algorithm that is essentially a black box.

%Geometric pattern mining is different from graph mining, as a matrix is more rigid and each element has a fixed degree of connectedness/adjacency. It is also unrelated to linear algebra, other then using the term `matrix' and a comparable style of notation.
